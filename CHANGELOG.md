## [1.3.0] - 2025-09-08

### Added
- Biome overlays, displayed when a map is in the inventory, that show the current biome. Additional biomes can be added via resource packs, with support for all of Minecraft's biomes included.
  - Mod support is in the works - Atmospheric, Quark, and Nature's Spirit have biomes included in this release. Always looking for contributions, and more can be added by modpackers.
  - Adding more biomes is simple. As an example, to add a texture to Dunes from Atmospheric (`atmospheric:dunes`), your resource pack should have a texture with the path `assets/atmospheric/textures/immersiveoverlays/dunes.png`.
  - Immersive Overlays also has a system for redirects - allowing multiple biomes to use the same texture. To add a redirect to Flourishing Dunes from Atmospheric (`atmospheric:flourishing_dunes`) so that it reuses the texture of Dunes, your resource pack should have a text file with the path `assets/atmospheric/textures/immersiveoverlays/dunes.txt`, with the contents `atmospheric:dunes`.
- Temperature overlays, displayed when a thermometer is in the inventory, that show the current temperature.
  - In vanilla, this data is sourced from the biome's temperature.
  - With [Oreganized](https://modrinth.com/mod/oreganized) installed, this data is sourced from the Thermometer.
  - With [Tough as Nails](https://modrinth.com/mod/tough-as-nails) installed, this data is sourced from the player's temperature.
  - With [Cold Sweat](https://modrinth.com/mod/cold-sweat/) installed, this data is sourced from the player's temperature.
  - With [Legendary Survival Overhaul](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/legendary-survival-overhaul) installed, this data is sourced from the player's temperature.
- Season overlays, displayed when a calendar is in the inventory, that show the current season.
  - Supports [Serene Seasons](https://modrinth.com/mod/serene-seasons), [Fabric Seasons](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-seasons), and [Simple Seasons](https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-seasons).
- Speed overlays, displayed when a speedometer is in the inventory, that display the current speed.
  - Supports [Oreganized](https://modrinth.com/mod/oreganized).
