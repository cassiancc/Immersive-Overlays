### Added
- Support for detecting [Antique Atlas 4](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas-4) items in containers. This requires the mod to be configured to require an item, and will work when the mod is remapped by Sinytra Connector.
- A global "on/off" setting has been added to the config, which can be changed via a keybind (default binding is disabled).

### Fixed
- Locator bar toggle now uses the correct config.
